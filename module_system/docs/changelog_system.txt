Module System

V4.4.2 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: the image text-plugin used a wrong font-path, therefore text-operations failed (e.g. when rendering a captcha image)

V4.4.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG: mail-notifications sent by the messaging subsystem could use a wrong recipient for cases where the mail-sender was set explicitly

V4.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: added new method which gets all subnodes of a given node recursively
NEW: class_date accepts instances of class_date as a constructor param
NEW: if an object is copied and the object provides a title-property, the framework adds _copy to the new instances title. Otherwise, source and copy-objects could not be distinguished.
NEW: removed the (deprecated since 4.0) form-validation methods from class_admin
NEW: added a common base class for admin / portal views, class_ui_base. Reduces copied code-fragments #871
NEW: finally, the reference to class_db at class_ui_base is removed. the (deprecated since 4.0) access is no longer possible.
NEW: moved many listener-callbacks to their own objects, reducing the size of many model-classes #872
NEW: added class_history, a new central class to manage the history stacks of both, backend and portal requests of the current session (was located at class_admin / class_portal before). The stack is filled by the request-dispatcher, reducing the number of session-updated per request.
NEW: changes in field validation: All Fields are now validated (even if they are not mandatory). Mandatory fields cannot be empty anymore
NEW: added new interface which extends the interface interface_validator. This new interface contains a method which returns a validation message for this field
NEW: properties may be parametrized. A parameter is added to a property using the common java-syntax, e.g. "hello my {0}". Pass replacements ins an optional array. #840
NEW: the captcha image is also generated by class_image2. this means that the last remaining parts relying on class_image are now removed. class_image will remain at least until v 4.5 to remain backwards compatibility. #784
NEW: the debug-info is added as valid html for web-requests. on xml-/json-requests, the debug-info is added as an additional http-header (not polluting the real output)
NEW: the backend-template path-determination was moved to class_resourceloader. this ensures the caching is only done once.
NEW: class_session caches the current skin and backend language in the session. performance boost.
NEW: class_resourceloader caches admin-templates, too. performance boost.
NEW: the backend module navigation is build on the module-objects instead of the admin-obejcts. this reduces the number of object-initializations drastically as soon as the navigation-parts are generated and cached on first load. performance boost.
NEW: generic ajax call method: if an error is thrown the call back will also be called
NEW: Refactored the event-dispatcher. The implementation is now generic, so the listener-interfaces are no longer hardcoded. This means, event-interface may be provided by every module. Added some unit-tests to verify the functionality.
NEW: if a record is being copied, the progress itself is indicated by a loading animation
NEW: introduces a new permission "changelog" (the first new permission for 9 years :) ). Hidden by default, the permission may be used to control which groups are allowed to view the changelog of a record independent from the objects view/edit permissions. #847
NEW: the admin-url redirects to the installer if the system is not yet installed, too (now the same behaviour like the portal calls)
NEW: Object-Locks are respected when setting an objects' sort-position
NEW: checkbox_formentry: it is now possible to disable a check box
NEW: added new formentry which creates a On-Off-Toggle button using bootstrap-switch (www.bootstrap-switch.org)
NEW: added new form entry which contains two drop down boxes, one for month and one for year
NEW: added a callback to class_admin onRenderOutput(), useful to inject elements into the rendered backend-page
APICHANGE: the force-param of class_lockmanager::unlockRecord unlocks the locked record in every case, even if the user is no member of the admin group
APICHANGE: removed some methods in class_admin marked as deprecated since 4.0
APICHANGE: removed class_(root|admin|portal) getStatus, deprecated since 4.0. setStatus will follow. use (set|get)IntRecordStatus instead
BUG: the system_changelog restorer no longer triggers a hidden updateObjectToDb, e.g. due to setting the record-status of a record (field is set to ignore)
BUG: on 32bit systems, some long values could be truncated due to an uncecked int / long / float cast
BUG: the url to be loaded after deleting a record is now checked to not match the deleted records system-id. this could have lead to exceptions due to a record no longer existing.
BUG: moving a formentry to the list of hidden elements validates if the element was added to the list of visible elements twice
BUG: class_image2 missed to send the headers before starting to stream the image itself
BUG: flushing the resourceloaders' cache flushes the static caches, too (and not only the filesystem-based caches)
BUG: the response-code for exception was not set to 500 for some cases
BUG: the formmanager skips object-locks if a new record is created. when editing existing records, the locks are set as before. locking new objects could lead to locks on the prev-id, resulting in locked module-objects waiting for the lock-timeout.
BUG: the order of child-records could be mixed up when copying an object. ART#829


V4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: Added annotations @module, @moduleId for module and moduleId declarations. makes constructors obsolete in many cases. #830
NEW: the wysiwygsmall formentry allows images and links to be placed in the content
NEW: added a new annotation @fieldHidden for formentries. if set, the entry is rendered in the optional-elements section of the form.
NEW: chart-engines are instantiated dynamically, no longer hardcoded calls #836
NEW: class_resourceloader::getFolderContent is able to filter the list of files being returned using a callback-method. the callback is passed to array_filter, so the same syntax and behaviour is applied
NEW: added a new formentry "plaintext" to inject code like js-fragments into forms
NEW: updated jQuery to 1.10.2
NEW: moved the admintask-js logic to own, static methods. may be used by other classes to reduce the amount of copy n paste code.
NEW: optimized the systemtask-list rendering, a tasks' admin-form is only generated in case the task is really executed.
NEW: added task / batch processing based class_image2. will replace class_image.
NEW: Pluginmanager for admin plugins implementing interface_admin_plugin.
NEW: added the class class_module_system_changelog_restorer, used to restore single values from the changelog back to the linked object
NEW: added a method containsSection to class_template in order to validate the presence of a section within a template
NEW: the generic actionList @ class_admin_evensimpler creates a list-identifier (listTypename)  by default
NEW: the changelog may be temporary disabled to speed up script execution
NEW: settings are cached internally, reducing the amount of queries per request
NEW: class_date supports setNext/PreviousMonth/Week
NEW: systemtask-executions are logged with level WARNING to their own logfile
NEW: introduced a new annotation "@fieldDDValues", relevant for dropdown admin-form entries. The value is a list of [key=>value],[key=>value] pairs, resolved from the language-files. This makes it obsolete to pass the language-file based options programmatically
NEW: class_link, replacing all link-functions in functions.php. getLinkAdminRaw is replaces by (nearly identical) getLinkAdminManual
NEW: added system time info to systemInfo view
NEW: A custom error-message in case of validation-errors may be provided to formentries. If not given, the label is still being used instead.
NEW: added an integer-validator
NEW: added javascript function KAJONA.v4skin.appendLinkToPathNavigation. adds a simple link to the currents page path-navigation.
NEW: when including a config file fails, the name of the file is printed in every case
NEW: the adminform-handler tries to load the values from the params even if there is no passed source-object
NEW: folderview-based actions (so dialogs) are not added to the history-stack
BUG: when the validation of an evensimpler form failed, the systemid could get lost. the resulted in records with a wrong prev-id
BUG: tags are stripped from an objects display-name when throwing exceptionsBUG: the mail action of module system missed to url-decode params before rendering the values
BUG: fixed the urlencoding of the image-cropper cross links
BUG: The sort-criteria for generic select-statements was skipped in case the @listOrder annotation used only the column name (without the table name)
BUG: some filesystem operation replace a possible _realpath_ part of the passed filename. otherwise some cache-flushing methods fail and could lead to a corrupt cache on package installs / updates.
BUG: the core event-dispatcher cached some instances using the wrong static variable
BUG: null-values could have been replaced with empty strings before passing them to the db-driver. this caused problems on some dbms like postgres
BUG: changed the way the wysiwyg is initialized. this avoids problems with div-tags named the same as some backend-skin css classes / ids.
BUG: the automatic aspect-changer is only triggered, if the target aspect is visible



V4.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: added a new form-entry "user", used to select a user from the user-management, includes autocomplete. Therefore the old toolkit-user selector was updated to the latest jqueryUI changes.
NEW: added a new interface "interface_formentry_printable", extending the interface_formentry. By adding a method "getValueAsText", form-entries may be used to generate a "read only" or a summary view of a single object / form
NEW: before sending a generated update-query to the database, int/bit property values are casted explicitly. Required by some RDBMS.
NEW: added an image-mapper for the backend-skins. The mapper is expected for each skin, named class_adminskin_imageresolver (implementing interface_adminskin_imageresolver). The imageresolver transforms names like "icon_edit" into a matching img-tag or an i-tag, as used by the current skin. #804
NEW: added formentry textrow, usable to render a hint without a matching form-element
NEW: more typesafety on date getters / setters in class_root
NEW: the backend navigation entries are cached per aspect, this allows a module to render different actions depending on the current aspect
NEW: module-id files may use an additional underscore
NEW: added class_admin_formgenerator::removeField() to remove an already added entry from a form
BUG: system-changelog missed the ORDER BY criteria for a merged resultset
BUG: when rendering a list via class_admin_evensimpler, the original action is restored temporarily. Otherwise the page rendered below the list of records would use "list" for every object-type, resulting in a broken paging-link/erroneous link.
BUG: the new, decoupled image generation missed to keep the image ratio
BUG: fixed session close error during image generation
BUG: some special chars could create broken dialog-links in the backend. #805
BUG: the lang-scriptlet missed to register for the context 'portal-page'. this could lead to scriptlet-placeholder not being replaced in case of xml requests.
BUG: admin-formgenerator passes null for empty dates instead of an empty string
BUG: language-files may contain additional underscores for the module-part
BUG: reenabled the system-config "admintoolkit". The specified class-name is evaluated and resolved correctly.
BUG: double-slashes are removed from paths resolved by class_resourceloader
