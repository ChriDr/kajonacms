- class_root::getObjectTables() was removed, table declarations are now stored within the class' doc-comment
- class_root::getModuleSystemid() was removed, to be fetched by the regular module-classes

Versioning
Versioning as provided by interface_versionable and class_module_system_changelog have been refactored. The properties monitored for versioning
have to be marked with the annotation @versionable. By default, the property is added by its' name. If necessary, an alias may be used
by adding the name inline with the annotation, e.g. @versionable name1. The old- and new-values are determined automatically.
The interface-methods have been renamed to be more specific, please update your implementations.

Module Search:
There are now two separated plugin-structures: The portal searchplugins and the admin searchplugins. In consequence, the interface and plugins
need the postfix _admin / _portal.
