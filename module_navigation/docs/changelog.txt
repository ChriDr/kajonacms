Module Navigation


V4.4-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: the navigation-tree node is added to the treeview, too. Otherwise the dragging of nodes to top-level could fail.
BUG: the sitemap-template used a wrong ul/li nesting
BUG: the navigation elements' field "include foreign modules" showed "no" for new, uninitialized element-entries, even if the foreign modules were included.
