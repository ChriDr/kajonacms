As stated on http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Oxygen/Licensing, 2012/09:
 Use on Websites

Oxygen Icons can be used on websites, they are excellent for making even the most boring website pretty (look at this one).

You should include a link to http://www.oxygen-icons.org/ in a prominant and relevant part of your website (e.g. a credits page) and
make it clear that the icons may be freely copied under the LGPLv3 (either by linking to the LGPL on the GNU website or by including a full copy).
If you have modified the icon SVGs you should include a link to where they can be downloaded.
