+++ README Selenium user-extension for Kajona testing +++

Kajona comes with several Selenium tests for Selenium IDE (Firefox extension)

Some of these tests use functions which are not default Selenium functions. To use theses tests 
you have to add the file 'kajona-user-extension.js' to your Selenium IDE.

Go to Options -> "Selenium Core extensions (user-extensions.js)" and specify the file.
You can add more than one extention file by adding a comma seperated list of values.

Without this extension some of the tests will NOT work!!

If you have any Questions feel free to open a ticket on trace.kajona.de
