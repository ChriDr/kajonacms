Module Mediamanager

V4.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: mediamanger-files are renderd with an addition download-icon (to download the file in the backend, too)
NEW: the mediamanager / folderview selector contains a link to the image-repository and a link to a list of all repositories when selecting a link-target #800
BUG: when opening a mediamanager repo, the sync is triggered only if the user has upload permissions
